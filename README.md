# UnitySpaceShooter
Record of work completed for Unity's "Space Shooter" tutorial.

While most of this code is almost identical to what the tutorial follows, there are soem key differences. 
The original tutorial refered certain variables and functions through their currently-deprecated naming schemes. Unity 5 now uses the
`GetComponent<ComponentType>()` method of component access, so this code reflects that. There is also the newer "WebGL" build target which
replaces the older "Unity Web Player" target, which is reflected in this project as well.

There's also a severe lack of comments because I was following along with the tutorial, although the tutorial does a very good
job of explaining the functions and methedologies that go into making a building a game with Unity.
